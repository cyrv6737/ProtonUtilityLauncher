## What is this for?

This is a simple frontend for Protontricks that allows the user to launch game utilities, namely ones that require post-game-launch memory hacks, under Proton. This was made with Ultrawide users in mind for things like Flawless Widescreen and trainers from talented individuals like Rose and others from WSGF/PCGW.
