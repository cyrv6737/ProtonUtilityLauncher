# ProtonUtilityLauncher
A python GUI to launch external utilities for games under Proton.

![cover](https://github.com/cyrv6737/ProtonUtilityLauncher/blob/main/cover.png)

## What is this for?

This is a simple frontend for Protontricks that allows the user to launch game utilities, namely ones that require post-game-launch memory hacks, under Proton. This was made with Ultrawide users in mind for things like Flawless Widescreen and trainers from talented individuals like Rose and others from WSGF/PCGW.

I plan for the functionality to remain this and only this, otherwise one might as well use SteamTinkerLauncher.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Protontricks
- python-vdf

## Limitations

- Can only find games installed on the primary drive (WIP)
- Windows go unresponsive for some reason, but doesn't compromise functionality of the program (WIP)
- When using Flawless Widescreen, use the 32-bit zip (WINE weirdness)
